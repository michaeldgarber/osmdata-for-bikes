# osmdata-for-bikes
The goal of this demo series is to illustrate use of the package osmdata to download OpenStreetMap vector data, with a focus on gathering bicycle infrastructure data in Atlanta. 

As of November, 2022, the urls have been updated, and the source code is no longer in this repository, but is instead in my repository called teach-r:
